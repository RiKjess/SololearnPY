elif Statements


Write a program that will be used in a robot that categorizes items by their color.
Each color corresponds to a box with a specific number.
For simplicity, our program will handle 3 colors:
red goes to box #1
green goes to box #2
black goes to box #3

Your program needs to take a color as input and output the corresponding box number.

Sample Input
green

Sample Output
2

color = input()
if color == ("red"):
    print ("1")
elif color == ("green"):
    print("2")
elif color == ("black"):
    print ("3")
