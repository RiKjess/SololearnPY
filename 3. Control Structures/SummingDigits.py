"""
while Loops


The given program calculates and outputs the number of digits in a given number using a while loop.
n = int(input())
length = 0
while n > 0:
    n //= 10
    length += 1
    
print(length) 

During each iteration, the loop uses floor division to divide the given number by 10, thus dropping one digit.
The process continues until the number has no more digits (n>0).

You need to change the code to calculate and output the sum of all digits of the input number.

Sample Input
643

Sample Output
13

Explanation
The sum of the digits of 643 is 6+4+3 = 13.

n = int(input())

sum = 0

while n > 0:
   a = n%10
   sum += a
   n //= 10
    
print(sum)
