Returning from Functions


We are creating our own social network application and need to have a hashtag generator program.
Complete the program to output the input text starting with the hashtag (#).
Also, if the user entered several words, the program should delete the spaces between them.

Sample Input
code sleep eat repeat

Sample Output
#codesleepeatrepeat

Hint
You can use the replace() function to replace the spaces (" ") with empty strings (""). See how it works:
s = "I like pears"
s1 = s.replace("pears", "apricots")
print(s1)

#prints I like apricots
"""

s = input()

def hashtagGen(text):
	s1 = s.replace(" ", "")
	
	return("#" + s1)

print(hashtagGen(s))
